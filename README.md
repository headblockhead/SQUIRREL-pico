# SQUIRREL Pico: SQUIRREL for the Raspberry Pi Pico.
<sup>or: Simplified QMK Uniquely Immaculate (and) Readable Runtime Editable Library</sup>

ðŸš§ This project is currently **under construction**, so do not expect a usable result yet! ðŸš§

This is an implementation of [SQUIRREL](https://github.com/headblockhead/SQUIRREL) as a template example for a 5-key keyboard.

## Tasks

### Build
Directory: ./build

Builds the keyboard firmware.

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j4 SQUIRREL-pico
```

### Build-debug
Directory: ./build

Builds the keyboard firmware with debug build type.

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .. 
make -j4 SQUIRREL-pico
cp compile_commands.json ../ # Copies the autocomplete information for ccls.
```

### Clean
Cleans the build directory for a fresh build.

```bash
rm -rf ./build
mkdir build
```

### Init-submodules

Fetches SQUIRREL and the pico-sdk submodules for use in the project.
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Update-submodules
Requires: init-submodules

This fetches the latest version of SQUIRREL and the pico-sdk from their remotes. Be careful of breaking changes!

```bash
git submodule update --remote
```
